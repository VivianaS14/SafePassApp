## Active Record Encryption

First you need to run this command

```
bin/rails db:encryption:init
```

It should respond with something like this:

```
Add this entry to the credentials of the target environment:

active_record_encryption:
  primary_key: EGY8WhulUOXixybod7ZWwMIL68R9o5kC
  deterministic_key: aPA5XyALhf75NNnMzaspW7akTfZp0lPY
  key_derivation_salt: xEY0dt6TZcAMg52K7O84wYzkjvbA62Hz
```

Then you need to save those credentials with the following command:

```
EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
```

Copy the credentials bellow and save it at the end of the file, then close it and in console you should see something like these

```
Configured Git diff driver for credentials.
Editing config/credentials.yml.enc...
File encrypted and saved.
```

In model you can encrypt data using these:

```
encrypts :username, deterministic: true
encrypts :password
```

## Turbo Frame

Turbo Frames allow predefined parts of a page to be updated on request.

To use turbo frame you can wrap the content you want to update:

```erb
<!-- app/views/entries/index.html.erb -->
<%= turbo_frame_tag('main-dashboard') do %>
  <%= render(partial: 'entries/main', locals: {entry: @main_entry}) %>
<% end %>
```

Then each trigger action link should have as data the id gave it to the turbo frame:

```erb
<!-- app/views/entries/_entry.html.erb -->
<%= link_to(entry_path(entry), class: 'nav-link', data: {turbo_frame: 'main-dashboard'}) do %>
   ...
<% end %>
```

Finally, the view that should be render in the frame should be:

```erb
<!-- app/views/entries/show.html.erb -->
<%= turbo_frame_tag('main-dashboard') do %>
  ...
<% end %>
```

## Turbo Stream

Turbo Streams deliver page changes as fragments of HTML wrapped in <turbo-stream> elements. Each stream element specifies an action together with a target ID to declare what should happen to the HTML inside it.

They can be used to surgically update the DOM after a user action such as removing an element from a list without reloading the whole page, or to implement real-time capabilities such as appending a new message to a live conversation as it is sent by a remote user.

```erb
app/views/entries/index.html.erb

<%# We put as data the id for the part we wanna change with turbo stream, in this case "main-dashboard" %>
    <%= link_to('+ New Entry', new_entry_path, class: 'btn btn-primary', data: {turbo_frame: "main-dashboard"})%>

<div class="entries-card__main">
  <%# Envolvemos la secciÃ³n que queremos modificar dentro de un turbo frame %>
  <%= turbo_frame_tag('main-dashboard') do %>
    <%= render(partial: 'entries/main', locals: {entry: @main_entry}) %>
  <% end %>
</div>
```

In the controller, we need to send the respond as turbo stream, in this case we use files as responses

```erb
if @entry.save
  flash.now[:notice] = "<strong>#{@entry.name}<strong> has saved!".html_safe
  # Tu use turbo stream we use a respond block
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html { redirect_to root_path }
    format.turbo_stream { }
  end
else
  render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
end
```

Then create the file with the action name and ending with turbo_stream, because this is a turbo stream response

```erb
app/views/entries/create.turbo_stream.erb
```
